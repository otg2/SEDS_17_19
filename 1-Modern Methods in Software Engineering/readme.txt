Note - you can quickly log in as any user with specific role by clicking a corresponding button to the right.
Each button has a name and role registered to it. 

For example - log in as Jack, click the "JACK - Production Manager" button.

Otherwise you can write the name in CAPS and use the password "hallo1" for every registered user.

For example - log in as Jack (Production Manager)

Username: JACK
Password: hallo1

If you would like to register additional users in the system, write their first name in the Username in caps and
then choose a password. This is due to already assigned roles in database.

For example - registering Raymond the graphic designer
Username: RAYMOND
Password: WhateverYouLike
RepeatPa: WhateverYouLike

If you would like to register yourself, go ahead. But you will not have permission to do anything.
Except viewing events. Your primary role will be No Role Assigned

For example - registering myself in the system
Username: OTTARG
Password: gurka123
RepeatPa: gurka123
