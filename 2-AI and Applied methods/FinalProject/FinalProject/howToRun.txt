SETUP
1.  Make sure Tensorflow, Scipy and Numpy are installed
2. 	Copy the 'output' folder to C (or root)
3. 	Open Anaconda prompt
4. 	Locate the folder where modded_GAN.py is
5.	Activate Tensorflow

EDIT IMAGES
1. 	Put the desired image amount in the data folder
2. 	Run 'python editimages.py'

TO TRAIN
1. 	Open modded_GAN.py
2. 	Uncomment train()
3. 	Comment createFromCheckpoint()
4.	run 'python modded_GAN.py'

TO GENERATE IMAGE AFTER TRAINING
1. 	Open modded_GAN.py
2. 	Comment train()
3. 	Uncomment createFromCheckpoint()
4. 	Open C://output/our/checkpoint and change the 
		model_checkpoint_path: "/output/our/model3000"
	to any model available (2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000)
5.	run 'python modded_GAN.py'
